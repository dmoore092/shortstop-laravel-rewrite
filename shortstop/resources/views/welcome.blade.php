        <p class="lead">Our mission is to build a strong community between Athletes and Coaches to create positive outcomes in life and in the
            game for all involved. <br />
            <br />
            We strive to provide High School and JUCO athletes the tools to successfully promote themselves to college coaches by assisting
            athletes through the recruiting process. Our goal is to be a mentor-leader to student-athletes to teach them the importance of
            academics and athletics while showing strong leadership characteristics to be successful on and off the playing field
